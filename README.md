Using the pixel shift method, we increase the resolution of a 8x8 sensor to a 16x16 resolution

Currently no pixel shift is being done.

Fixed for actual hardware
Arduino code uses an Arduino Uno R3 with Grid-Eye click from MicroE, changed adress to 0x68 from Sparkfun's default 0x69

Run 1.py to launch the GUI.
